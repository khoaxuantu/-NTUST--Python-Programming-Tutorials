# Judge The BMI
 
<b>Purpose:</b>
- Please write a program to calculate BMI and check if it is over-weighted.
- Ask users to input height (cm) and weight (kg).
- Judge the BMI by the following criteria:
- BMI < 18.5 → “Underweight”
- 18.5 ≦ BMI ＜25 → “Normal weight”
- BMI ≧ 25 → “Overweight”

<b>Hints:</b>
- BMI = (Weight(kg))/Height(m)**2  (Convert "cm" to "m" before the calculation)
- Limit the output to 2 digits of decimal by "{:.2f}".format()
