# Transcription of DNA to RNA
 
<b>Purpose:</b>
- Write a program to ask the input of DNA sequence from users, and convert it into RNA sequence.
- The process of converting a DNA sequence to RNA is called "Transcription".


<b>Description & Requirements:</b>
- Our body works on the mechanism of “DNA -> RNA -> Proteins -> Functions”.
- Here are the rules for DNA -> RNA Transcription:
- A -> U    T -> A    G -> C    C -> G
- Ask users to enter a sequence of DNA and convert it into RNA.
- Print the error message "Invalid DNA Symbols" when you find the DNA symbols are other than A, T, G and C.
- DNA symbols should be case insensitive.


<b>Hints:</b>
- Try to iterate one symbol a time from inputted DNA sequence.
- Convert the symbol to RNA by the rules of transcription.
- Iterate all the characters of DNA by for-loop.
