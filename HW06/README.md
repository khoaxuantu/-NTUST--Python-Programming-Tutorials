# Factorial of N
 
<b>Purpose:</b>
- Write a program to calculate the factorial of that number (e.g., 10! = 1x2x3x…10).
- Ask user to input a number n (e.g., n = 10).
- Check if the inputted number has special definition in factorial:
- If n == 0, then 0! = 1
- If n < 0, then print out error message: “Error: Input number should be >= 0”.
- Save your script as Factorial.py and submit it.
