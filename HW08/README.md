- The output should be looks like the attached image.


<b>Hints:</b>
- You can use nested loop to do so.
- The outer loop will be from range(1, 10).  The inner loop will be from range(1, 10) also.
- The output could be similar to "{:2d} x {:2d} = {:2d}".format(i, j, i*j), where i, j are the index variables of outer and inner loop.
