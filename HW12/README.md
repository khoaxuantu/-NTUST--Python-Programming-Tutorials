# Calculate the length of a person's name
 
<b>Purpose:</b>
- There is a tuple that stores the names of members as following:
- members = (“Robert”, “Lucy”, “Frank”)
- Please use the tuple generator to generate a tuple like ("name", length) as following:
- name_length = ((“Robert”, 6), (“Lucy”, 4), (“Frank”, 5))


<b>Hints:</b>
- Iterate each element by for in the Tuple Generator.
- Use len() to calculate the length of names.
- Tuple Generator → ((“Name”, len() of name)  for-loop)
- To print the results → print(tuple(name_length))
- The execution results are shown below:<br>
  ((“Robert”, 6), (“Lucy”, 4), (“Frank”, 5))
