# BMI with functions in multiple lines
 
## Purpose:
- Write a program with two functions to calculate BMI as well as judge it.


## Hints:
- Create “BMI” project in PyCharm.
- Create a BMIFunctions.py file with two functions:
- BMI_calc(cm, kg)： Pass in cm and kg and return the BMI value.
- BMI_judge(bmi)： Pass in BMI value and return either "Underweight", "Normal weight", or "Overweight".
- Import BMIFunctions in main.py and calculate BMI value as well as comment the BMI by functions defined in BMIFunctions.py.
